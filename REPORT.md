## Reflections on Process
Our team had a very smooth development process overall. The only period of time that was a bit stressful was prior to the submission of the `DESIGN` milestone but that was mostly because we wrongly believed we needed to have the entire webscraper functionality working by then & didn't realize that the mock data was sufficient for that period of time. There were also a few hiccups early on as we needed to make pretty large modifications to our use cases during the preliminary stages of design. However, investing a good amount of effort in planning things out helped a great deal during the actual implementation that took place during the two sprints that followed as our team had a clear understanding of each of the components of our bot. This was useful when we needed to assist each other with certain tasks. For example, Alex was able to help Dibya with validation for the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API component & Soumya was able to help Kim in writing tests for the web scraper functionality.

We believe the project in its entirety was structured very well as it took us through each major stage present in the development of a product with the five milestones we to complete over the course of the semester. We were able to learn about good scrum practices in lecture & given the chance to utilize them during the project by taking advantage of GitHub project boards, issue creation, PR approvals, daily standup meetings, etc. The lecture material did a good job at complementing the project materials which reinforced learning as we were able to put into action the topics we had just learned about. We also appreciated Dr.Ore providing reminders & pointing out things that we could be doing better as a team as the project progressed. For example, during the `PROCESS` milestone he left an issue that mentioned the need for more frequency & conversation around PRs which we incorporated moving forwards.
