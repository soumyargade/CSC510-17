## Problem GitEx Solved
Chat services, like Mattermost or Slack, are used regularly by software engineers to collaborate during the software development lifecycle. Collaboration between software engineers in chat sometimes leads to updates needed in GitHub for a variety of reasons; such as, version control, issue management, documentation, etc. Prior to GitEx, GitHub users could choose to make updates to GitHub via the graphical user interface (GUI), which requires more clicking around than our second option - making the update to GitHub via their REST API, which requires searching through GitHub API documentation to find the necessary information if it's not memorized. While the GitHub API has the opportunity to be much more efficient than the GitHub GUI, it is impeded by the requirement of needing to review GitHub API documentation every time it's used unless the user has had significant practice that allowed them to memorize the needed endpoints and scripts.

GitEx solves this issue by providing GitHub endpoints to Mattermost users for the features [pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls), [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues), and [repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos) on demand, overall reducing valuable time and increasing efficiency during the software development lifecycle. The bot goes further by being able to provide examples of shell commands or javascript code when requested; allowing users to effortlessly use the GitHub API in a command line interface (CLI). Another area GitEx solves for is the ability to present examples of successful response bodies, which is helpful for developers looking to use GitHub's API within an application and eliminates the need to tediously reference the API documentation throughout development.

## Reflections on Process
Our team had a very smooth development process overall. The only period of time that was a bit stressful was prior to the submission of the `DESIGN` milestone but that was mostly because we wrongly believed we needed to have the entire webscraper functionality working by then & didn't realize that the mock data was sufficient for that period of time. There were also a few hiccups early on as we needed to make pretty large modifications to our use cases during the preliminary stages of design. However, investing a good amount of effort in planning things out helped a great deal during the actual implementation that took place during the two sprints that followed as our team had a clear understanding of each of the components of our bot. This was useful when we needed to assist each other with certain tasks. For example, Alex was able to help Dibya with validation for the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API component & Soumya was able to help Kim in writing tests for the web scraper functionality.

We believe the project in its entirety was structured very well as it took us through each major stage present in the development of a product with the five milestones we to complete over the course of the semester. We were able to learn about good scrum practices in lecture & given the chance to utilize them during the project by taking advantage of GitHub project boards, issue creation, PR approvals, daily standup meetings, etc. The lecture material did a good job at complementing the project materials which reinforced learning as we were able to put into action the topics we had just learned about. We also appreciated Dr. Ore providing reminders & pointing out things that we could be doing better as a team as the project progressed. For example, during the `PROCESS` milestone he left an issue that mentioned the need for more frequency & conversation around PRs which we incorporated moving forwards. Overall, our team did a great job with daily scheduled scrum meetings, which allowed us to assign issues to team members on an ongoing basis and led to us always moving these issues acros the Kanban board from 'Not Started' to 'In Progress' to Complete.'
