4/12 | Soumya: Continued working on the Ansible script <br> Dibya: Created preliminary version of the ansible playbook <br> Alex: Working on Acceptance test for UC1 <br> Kim: Working on Acceptance test for UC2
4/13 | Soumya: Completed working ansible script. Will explore running the script from local machine instead of VCL. <br> Dibya: Testing ansible script. <br> Alex: Completed Acceptance test for UC1. Starting work on Acceptance test for UC3. <br> Kim: Completed on Acceptance test for UC2. Starting work on Acceptance test for UC3. |
4/14 | Soumya: Was able to get script to run from local machine. Looking into copying tokens from local environment variables to the remote VCL environment variables. <br> Dibya: Looking into using deploy key to copy repo rather than personal acceptance token. <br> Alex & Kim: Continued working on Acceptance test for UC3. Anticipate completing it by the next scrum meeting.
