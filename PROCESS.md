### Story Creation & Assignment
#### Iteration One
At the beginning of this iteration we divided each of our three use cases into stories & assigned story points as well as a developer to each of the tasks (as can be seen in the screenshot of our GitHub Project board below). For this iteration we plan to focus our efforts on fine tuning our web scraper's implementation as it is a foundational piece to the working of each of our use cases.

The screenshot below is a depiction of how our GitHub Project board looked at the **end** of this iteration. We were able to get the web scraper functionality working through ParseHub which means we're in good shape for finishing up our use cases in the next sprint. Work that remains on the board includes testing for each of the use cases as well as making sure that the implementation of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API is correct & able to fetch synonyms that correspond to HTTP verbs from user commands.

***Process Reflection***: Daily 15-20 minute scrum meetings in which we discussed progress & blockers really helped to keep our team on track and finish out tasks well before the deadline for this first sprint. We also began incorporating pair programming as one of our development practices as Kim & Soumya worked together for a coding session on the web scraper functionality with Soumya acting as the driver. We discovered that meeting more frequently helped to increase team cohesiveness as we were all more aware of what each other was working on which meant we could more effectively help out if necessary.

#### Iteration Two

At the beginning of this iteration we created a few more tasks for our use cases involving refactoring & refinement (ex: replace hard coded strings with env variables for API tokens). We moved issues to the "In Progress" column such that each team member would be able to start off working on a component of GitEx that was still incomplete (Kim & Soumya doing testing, Alex working on validation & error handling, & Dibya handling Merriam-Webster API integration with the other working components of GitEx already in place).

The screenshot below is a depiction of our GitHub Project board at the **end** of this iteration & milestone in general. We were able to finish integrating the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API functionality with the rest of the preexisting components of GitEx and also added in synonyms validation. We updated our testing suite to implement comprehensive tests for each of our use cases & got coverage up to 85%. There is no work that remains on the board or incomplete tasks as we were able to finish all that we had set out to do at the start of this sprint.

***Process Reflection***: We continued with our daily scrum meetings & pair programming practices as they'd proven effective in the previous sprint. We also asked each other for help as necessary in order to complete tasks that'd been assigned to us. For example, Alex & Dibya needed to communicate in order to figure out how to complete validation for synonyms as the Merriam Webster component was something Dibya had primarily taken charge of while error validation was a task Alex had been spearheading. Thus, in order to combine these two pieces of functionality, they needed to seek each other's guidance.

## Practices
### Core & Corollary Practices
A core practice we have integrated into our software development is **pair programming**.

A corollary practice we have integrated into our software development is **incremental deployment**, or in other words, gradually deploying functionality. This is a beneficial practice as in industry big deployment is high risk & can have high human and economic costs (slide 33 of Process_and_Git_Branches). For example, in our first sprint we deployed functionality for retrieving GitHub API documentation from our web scraper, ParseHub's, API as can be seen in the PR [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-s2022/CSC510-17/pull/43). After we were able to confirm that this was working we began working on functionality for integrating the Merriam-Webster dictionary API to map words in a user's request to the proper HTTP verbs. This functionality can be seen in the PR [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-s2022/CSC510-17/pull/49). This was deployed after the team was able to confirm that it was passing the required tests.

### Scrum Meeting Notes
#### Iteration One
| Date   | Progress & Blockers   |  Next Steps
| ------------- | ------------  |  ------------
| Sunday, March 20 | The team discussed work that will need to be completed for this sprint, created the necessary user stories, & added them to the project's Kanban board. | Soumya & Alex to research if there is a more viable alternative to ParseHub to use as the web scraper tool for scraping GitHub REST API documentation. Potential alternatives include the Cheerio library or Webscraper.io.
| Monday, March 21      | Soumya found Webscraper.io to be a better option than ParseHub due to ease of use with regards to its selector. However, there is a hefty price tag of $100/month in order to access the scraped data in a JSON format & use their API to programmatically retrieve data from scraping jobs. Dibya & Kim added user stories to the Kanban. |  <ul><li>**Kim**: Add story points + convert user stories in Kanban to GitHub issues. Assign each issue to a person.</li><li>**Dibya**: Merriam-Webster API integration.</li><li>**Alex**: Mattermost message handling & error handling.</li><li>**Soumya**: work on POC for Webscraper.io to determine if it can replace ParseHub.</li></ul>
| Tuesday, March 22      | <ul><li>**Kim**: Finished adding story points to each user story & converted them into issues.</li><li>**Dibya**: Created skeleton code for Merriam-Webster API.</li><li>**Alex**: Began error handling for invalid commands sent by the user for any of the use cases.</li><li>**Soumya**: Confirmed Webscraper.io is not a feasible option as parsing jobs aren't working when run from within the cloud, a feature that is necessary in order to access scraped data via API calls.</li></ul>             | <ul><li>**Dibya**: Continue working on logic to pull correct HTTP verb based on the synonyms of the action the user chooses. </li><li>**Alex**: Continue to work on error handling. </li><li>**Soumya**: Work on improving ParseHub implementation from what was accomplished during the `BOT` milestone.</li></ul>
| Wednesday, March 23      | <ul><li>**Dibya**: Added logic to parse Merriam-Webster API response to compile synonym list. </li><li>**Alex**: Made progress on error handling logic. </li><li>**Soumya**: Figured out how to modify use of the selector on ParseHub in order to reference retrieved data by key value. Created scraping jobs for each of the necessary APIs & generated tokens. </li></ul> | <ul><li>**Kim**: Pair programming with Soumya to help build out ParseHub logic. </li><li>**Dibya**: Work on logic to pull correct HTTP verb from synonym list. </li><li>**Alex**: Continue to work on error handling.</li><li>**Soumya**: Pair programming with Kim to build out ParseHub logic based off the new structure of the retrieved JSON files from calls to ParseHub's API. </li></ul>
| Thursday, March 24      | <ul><li>**Kim**: Finished ParseHub implementation changes with Soumya. PR reviewed & merged. </li><li>**Dibya**: Completed connecting and parsing response for Merriam-Webster API. PR in review. </li><li>**Alex**: Completed message & error handling on Mattermost. PR reviewed & merged. </li><li>**Soumya**: Finished ParseHub implementation changes with Kim. PR reviewed & merged. </li></ul>             | <ul><li>**Kim**: Begin modifying tests based off the changes made to the format of the data retrieved from ParseHub. </li><li>**Dibya**: Plan thesaurus API integration into existing code & tests for sprint 2. </li><li>**Alex**: Review tests for sprint 2 and identify gaps in code logic to patch in sprint 2.  </li><li>**Soumya**: Help Kim modify tests & add documentation for the sprint to `PROCESS.md`. </li></ul>
| Friday, March 25      | The team reviewed modifications Alex made to Mattermost validation to ensure the general flow of users entering proper commands is working & merged this PR (which also included Dibya's Merriam-Webster API additions). The team also reviewed & merged Kim's PR addressing changes to our testing suite. We also added necessary documentation to wrap up this sprint (iteration worksheet, process reflection, etc). | We plan to discuss issues that remain leading into sprint 2 & also review tests that would be good additions to our current suite with regards to command validation, formatting of GitEx responses, etc. We will also think on how we can improve our overall software development process to be more effective as a team.
