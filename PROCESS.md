#### Scrum Meeting Notes
* 3/20  
  * Everyone: Create user stories for the sprint and add to the project kanban board
  * Soumi & Alex: Research which web scraper tool to use for scraping the Github REST API documentation. Possible choices are the Cheerio library, Parsehub, or Webscraper.io. Additionally begin thinking of implementation methods.
* 3/21
  * Progress:
    *  Soumi found the webscraper.io web scraping tool to be the better option as it has an easier user interface. The downside is that it is not free for the use cases that we need from it.
    *  Dibya & Kim: Added user stories to kanban
  * Next:
    *  Kim: Add story points + convert user stories in kanban to github issues. Assign each issue to a person.
    *  Dibya: Merriam-Webster API integration
    *  Alex: Mattermost message handling/error handling
    *  Soumi: Continue to review webscraper.io as a web scraping option
* 3/22
  * Progress:
    *  Soumi: confirmed webscraper.io is not an option
    *  Dibya: Created skeleton code for Merriam-Webster API
    *  Kim: finished adding the story points to each user story and I turned them into issues
    *  Alex: Began error handling for invalid commands sent by the user. 
  * Next:
    *  Soumi: work on improving parsehub implementation from what was done during the bot milestone
    *  Dibya: continue working on logic to pull correct HTTP verb based on the synonyms of the action the user uses
    *  Kim: 
    *  Alex:
