## Problem Statement
In software engineering, collaboration is important whether it's with the team you’re working with or with other software engineers around the world. Oftentimes, software engineers ask questions that have been asked before, and this causes a redundant seek of information. In a world where information is so readily available, it is inefficient to wait to find someone who might know the answer to your question.

For example, programmers frequently seek out example code illustrating common usage of APIs they’re trying to work with as absence of useful examples can make the APIs difficult to use. Oftentimes these inquiries take place on public help forums such as Stack Overflow. Being able to find examples quickly would save these developers an invaluable amount of time and energy.

## Bot Description
#### "Example Overflow: Never Wonder"
This bot would allow members of a private Stack Overflow team to be able to ask questions and when they need an explanation about the methodology and usage of an API call, the bot would scrape StackOverflow for examples. It will start with top rated answers and proceed from there. This bot would be a good solution for times when you have a question on a project but your teammates either don’t have an answer or are not available to answer your question.

A bot is a good solution to this problem as it will decrease the response time of a question. Rather than waiting for human users to respond to the incoming questions, a bot can automate this and reply with an answer in seconds. It will also decrease the amount of time and effort required by developers to search for examples of an API call. Rather than scouring the web for examples, the bot will provide an example for them. This bot is an event-driven bot as it only responds to events (incoming questions).
